    ! Units 

    example : 

    we have N amount rupees , and we have 2 group that have  3 members in each group 

    group A & group B 

    Group A members take the money from the N amount rupees as per they want 

    now, group B members want , the double amount of the money group A takes 

    means if Group A has 3 members and they take money -> 100 , 200 & 300 

    then , group B has 3 members want to take money -> 200 ,  400 & 600 means the amount of money of Group B is depend on the Group A   


    ----------------------------------------------------------------


    in CSS we have 2 units -> 
    1. Absolute  -> not depends  { pixel , px , point, pt , inch - in }
    2. Relative  -> Depends on parent or root {%, vh,vw ( view port height and width )}
    
    % value depends on the parents value 
    vh & vw values depend on the screen
